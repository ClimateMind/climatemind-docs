# ðŸŒª Climate effects that will affect you the most

## Not a regular list of disasters

The problem is not a knowledge gap about climate change, but a knowledge connection and communication issue. This can be solved using an ontology that connects climate change effects and adaptation and mitigation solutions with geographic locations and personal values to enable a recommendation system that personalizes your personal feed and climate communication.

## Climate change effects

We generate a personalized climate feed for you based on your personal values and location zip code. It consists of climate change effects that will affect you the most.&#x20;

You can find the list of all climate change effects from our climate knowledge base in the article below:

{% content-ref url="../knowledge-base/climate-change-effects.md" %}
[climate-change-effects.md](../knowledge-base/climate-change-effects.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The app shares the personal risks of climate change along with personally motivating climate actions. There are two types of actions. See the next sections to learn about mitigation and adaptation actions :arrow\_right:
