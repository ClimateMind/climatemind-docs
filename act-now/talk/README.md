# ðŸ—£ Talk!

1. Bond over shared personal values and interests
2. Connect how climate impacts relate to your shared values and interests and how climate impacts are here today, where we live, affecting the things we care about most. And given the scale and speed of impacts, how it's an all-hands-on-deck situation.
3. Inspire with viable, accessible, practical and attractive solutions
