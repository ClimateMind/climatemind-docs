# Power

Control freak? Maybe. But in your eyes itâ€™s more about embracing power, holding dominance and getting the job done. You value social status and prestige.

Power is invaluable. After all, it likely enables you to control the people and situations around you. When you're on top of making the decision, you feel most yourself.

### Defining goal

&#x20;social status and prestige, control or dominance over people and resources. The functioning of social institutions apparently requires some degree of status differentiation (Parsons, 1951). A dominance/submission dimension emerges in most empirical analyses of interpersonal relations both within and across cultures (Lonner, 1980). To justify this fact of social life and to motivate group members to accept it, groups must treat power as a value. Power values may also be transformations of individual needs for dominance and control. Value analysts have mentioned power values as well (e.g., Allport, 1961).&#x20;

Both power and [achievement](achievement.md) values focus on social esteem. However, [achievement](achievement.md) values (e.g., ambitious) emphasize the active demonstration of successful performance in concrete interaction, whereas power values (e.g., authority, wealth) emphasize the attainment or preservation of a dominant position within the more general social system.

### Subtypes

* dominance (control over people)
