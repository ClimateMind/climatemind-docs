# Achievement

Success - thatâ€™s a major goal in your life. Meeting your own standards of excellence is very important to you. It propels you forward.

Likely a perfectionist at heart, you strive to be the best you can be. And if you get recognition and approval in the process, that really is the cherry on top.

### Defining goal:

&#x20;personal success through demonstrating competence according to social standards. Competent performance that generates resources is necessary for individuals to survive and for groups and institutions to reach their objectives. As defined here, achievement values emphasize demonstrating competence in terms of prevailing cultural standards, thereby obtaining social approval.&#x20;

(Achievement values differ from McClelland's (1961) achievement motivation. Achievement motivation concerns meeting internal standards of excellence. It is expressed in self-direction values.)
