# Stimulation

You highly value excitement, challenge, and positive change. Life is likely never dull with you around.

The world is a big place and you see the benefits of craving new experiences. On top of a need for variety and stimulation, you may also be a bit daring compared to most. You are likely a go-getter and change-maker at heart.

### Defining goal:

&#x20;excitement, novelty, and challenge in life. Stimulation values derive from the organismic need for variety and stimulation in order to maintain an optimal, positive, rather than threatening, level of activation (e.g., Berlyne, 1960). This need probably relates to the needs underlying self-direction values (cf. Deci, 1975).
