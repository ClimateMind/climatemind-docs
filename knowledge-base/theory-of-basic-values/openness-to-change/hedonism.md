# Hedonism

Joy, pleasure and satisfaction are a big part of what drives you. From big moments to the little things, you find bliss in enjoying what you do.

Whether through exploring the world or indulging in your favourite food, you likely love instant gratification and value decisions that reward your senses.

### Defining goal:

&#x20;pleasure or sensuous gratification for oneself. Hedonism values derive from organismic needs and the pleasure associated with satisfying them. Theorists from many disciplines (e.g., Freud, 1933; Williams, 1968) mention hedonism.&#x20;

(Although happiness is an important value, it is not included because people achieve it through attaining whatever outcomes they value (Sagiv & Schwartz, 2000)).
