# What is Climate Mind?

## **Why do we need Climate Mind?**

### **The Problem**

Climate change is one of the biggest, most complex challenges we currently face. While there is a  strong scientific consensus that it's a serious threat to our survival and civilization as we know it, the pace at which society is addressing the threat and implementing policy is too slow.&#x20;

### **The Solution**

Talking about climate change meaningfully with friends and family drives better understanding, motivation, and lasting change for faster climate action from the bottom up.

Conversations are [the most important way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BvcToPZCLI) we can fight climate change.
{% endhint %}

Why aren't we talking enough? There are [several key factors](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/news-events/attaining-meaningful-outcomes-from-conversations-on-climate/?mc\_cid=68964df70a\&mc\_eid=b33ed782a5) that Climate Mind addresses, such as:

* :brain:We think we donâ€™t know enough
* :family:We donâ€™t want to start an argument or harm our relationships
* ðŸ˜” We donâ€™t want to make others feel sad &#x20;

## Climate Mind to the rescue!

The [Climate Mind](https://climatemind.org/) app addresses these barriers by guiding users to effectively frame their conversations, strengthening relationships while discussing climate change in authentic and positive ways. We donâ€™t have to change peopleâ€™s values. People already have the values they need to care about a changing climate and be motivated to act, they just havenâ€™t realized it yet. They havenâ€™t connected the dots and found attractive solutions.
