# What is Climate Mind?

## **What it's all about?**

### **Problem**

Climate change is arguably one of the biggest and most complex challenges humanity currently faces. Although there is some consensus among people about climate change being a threat to our survival and civilization as we know it, the pace at which this is driving societal change or policy implementation is too slow.&#x20;

### **Challenges**

One way to help resolve this is by empowering people and making it easier for them to talk about climate change with their friends and family.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
We believe that conversations are [the most important thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BvcToPZCLI) to fight climate change
{% endhint %}

Unfortunately, there are [several reasons](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/news-events/attaining-meaningful-outcomes-from-conversations-on-climate/?mc\_cid=68964df70a\&mc\_eid=b33ed782a5) people donâ€™t talk to others about climate change with their friends and family:

* :brain:They feel they donâ€™t know enough
* :family:They donâ€™t want to start an argument or harm their relationship
* ðŸ˜” They donâ€™t want to make someone feel sad &#x20;

## Climate Mind comes up!

### How we can help?&#x20;

[Climate Mind](https://climatemind.org/) will address these barriers by making it easier for people to frame their conversations effectively, by connecting and discussing climate change in an authentic and positive way. We donâ€™t have to change peopleâ€™s values. People already have the values they need to care about a changing climate and be motivated to act, they just havenâ€™t realised it yet. They havenâ€™t connected the dots and found attractive solutions.
