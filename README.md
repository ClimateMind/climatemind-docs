# What is Climate Mind?

## **Why do we need Climate Mind?**

### **The Problem**

The biggest myth about climate change, isn't whether it's happening. Rather, it's [the myth that it doesn't personally affect us](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/international-public-opinion-on-climate-change-2022/). Scientists strongly agree: the impacts of climate change are here today, affecting each of us, the scale and speed of change is serious, threatening civilization as we know it, and we are responsible (mainly by burning fossil fuels). Fortunately, many hopeful solutions exist to address climate change while simultaneously making our lives better than they are today. But the pace and scale that we are implementing these solutions needs to be much faster to be appropriate.

{% hint style="success" %}
**83%** of Americans agree that climate change is happening! :tada:
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**42%** of Americans think it's caused mostly by human activities. :thinking:
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**22%** of Americans think that climate change will harm them personally! :disappointed\_relieved:
{% endhint %}

### **The Solution**

Talking about climate change meaningfully with friends and family drives better understanding, motivation, and lasting change for faster climate action from the bottom up.

{% hint style="info" %}
Conversations are :arrow\_forward:[the most important way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BvcToPZCLI) we can fight climate change.
{% endhint %}

Why aren't we talking enough? There are [several key factors](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/news-events/attaining-meaningful-outcomes-from-conversations-on-climate/?mc\_cid=68964df70a\&mc\_eid=b33ed782a5) that Climate Mind addresses, such as:

* :brain:We think we donâ€™t know enough
* :family:We donâ€™t want to start an argument or harm our relationships
* ðŸ˜” We donâ€™t want to make others feel sad &#x20;

## Climate Mind to the rescue!

The [Climate Mind](https://climatemind.org/) app addresses these barriers by guiding users to effectively frame their conversations, strengthening relationships while discussing climate change in authentic and positive ways. We donâ€™t have to change peopleâ€™s values. People already have the values they need to care about a changing climate and be motivated to act, they just havenâ€™t realized it yet. They havenâ€™t connected the dots and found attractive solutions.
